            <h2>Glass</h2>
            <h3>Types of Glass:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Soda-lime glass</li>
                <li>Borosilicate glass</li>
                <li>Tempered glass</li>
                <li>Laminated glass</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Chemical Properties</h3>
            <p>Glass is primarily composed of silicon dioxide. It is very strong and has unique conductivity properties.</p>
            <h3>Cost</h3>
            <p>The production costs and market prices of glass vary depending on the type and use. It is more expensivce then aluminum and plastic.</p>

            <h2>Comparative Analysis</h2>
            <h3>Material Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
            <p>Glass is strong and transparent but can be very brittle, making it easier to break under impact. Aluminum is light, strong, and corrosion-resistant, but it can be more expensive than other materials. Plastic is highly strong and durable, but its environmental impacts are a significant concern.</p>
            
            <h3>Cost Comparison</h3>
            <p>Glass production can be relatively cheap, but specialty glass types are more expensive. Aluminum's cost is changed by the type of alloy and market demand, with recycled aluminum being a cost-effective option. Plastic is generally cheap to produce, but prices change based on the type and application.</p>
            
            <h3>Application Suitability</h3>
            <p>Glass is ideal for applications requiring transparency and aesthetics, such as windows and containers. Aluminum is well-suited for construction and transportation because of how lightweight it is. Plastic's durability makes it suitable for a wide range of uses, from packaging to automotive parts, though its environmental impact must be considered.</p>
