            <h2>Comparative Analysis</h2>
            <h3>Material Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
            <p>Glass is strong and transparent but brittle, making it prone to breaking under impact. Aluminum is lightweight, strong, and corrosion-resistant, but it can be more expensive than other materials. Plastic is highly versatile and durable, but its environmental impact due to non-biodegradability is a significant concern.</p>
            
            <h3>Cost Comparison</h3>
            <p>Glass production can be relatively inexpensive, but specialty glass types like borosilicate are more costly. Aluminum's cost is influenced by the type of alloy and market demand, with recycled aluminum being a cost-effective option. Plastic is generally cheap to produce, but prices vary based on the type and specific applications.</p>
            
            <h3>Application Suitability</h3>
            <p>Glass is ideal for applications requiring transparency and aesthetic appeal, such as windows and containers. Aluminum is well-suited for structural applications in construction and transportation due to its strength and lightweight properties. Plastic's versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of uses, from packaging to automotive parts, though its environmental impact must be considered.</p>
